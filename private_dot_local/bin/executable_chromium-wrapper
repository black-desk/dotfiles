# NOTE:
# GNOME Shell launch application in a systemd scope not systemd service
# which causes some of the application processes
# leaks to the org.gnome.Shell cgroup
# if application fork too fast.
# Check this bug for more information:
# https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-shell/+bug/2011806
# This script waits for the cgroup set, then launch the real application.
